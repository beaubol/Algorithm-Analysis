For LCStwo.m and LCSthree.m

1.Run the file using MATLAB, prompt comes and just enter the length and press enter for each of the corresponding strings

2.It takes the length you have given and generates the corresponding lengthed DNA sequence

3.Finally it generates the length of the LCS and the LCS string

4.LCStwo.m for two strings and LCSthree.m for three strings

5.The backtracking is done with the help of matrix 'b'
